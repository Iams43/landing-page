# Project: Landing Page

This project is a professional, responsive landing page built as part of the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com) at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). 

## 🎯 Project Goal
The objective was to take a provided design mockup and translate it into a fully functional webpage using clean **HTML** and modern **CSS** techniques. This assignment marks the culmination of the CSS foundations module, focusing heavily on layout architecture.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
*   **Flexbox Mastery:** Used `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, and `align-items` to create complex layouts without using floats or tables.
*   **Document Structure:** Organizing a semantic HTML document with clear sections (`header`, `hero`, `content`, `footer`).
*   **Styling & Design:** Implementing custom fonts, color palettes, and decorative elements like rounded corners and hover effects.
*   **Problem Solving:** Breaking down a large visual design into small, manageable "div" containers.

## 🏗️ Page Sections
1.  **Header:** Navigation bar with a logo and links.
2.  **Hero Section:** High-impact area featuring a title, secondary text, and a placeholder image.
3.  **Information Section:** A four-column grid showing off features or products using images and subtext.
4.  **Quote Section:** A stylized testimonial with a contrasting background.
5.  **Call to Action:** A bright, attention-grabbing banner to encourage user sign-ups.
